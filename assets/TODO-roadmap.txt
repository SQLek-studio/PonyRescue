List of jobs, also milestones. When we are both online, we must keep
commit/push shorts. WIP means somepony is working with it in local copy.

Gui for menus.
    Affetced files:
        Assets/Textures/Slides/Main
        Assets/Textures/Slides/Credits

Think about control/user interaction.
Have any ideas Xinef?
If we use mouse, then targeting will be simple, but no split screen multi.
> Proposition for keybord only:
> A-D rotating camera, W-S selecting target up-down, space or ctrl is action
> ←-→ rotating camera, ↑-↓ targeting and enter or right ctrl as action
// in my opinion split-screen will bring extra gameplay and ability to run
// our game in pony meets.
# on other hoof using mouse to targeting is more straighforward, also rotating ad firing by mouse is posible.
# i need Your opinion before i start implementing event handlers.

//i'm currently working on scene and code. Tomorow we will have more files to parallel working.
